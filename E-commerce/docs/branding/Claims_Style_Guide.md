# Claims & Messaging Style Guide (AromaCo)

Purpose
- Ensure compliant, consistent language across web, packaging, and ads; avoid medical claims.

Allowed Themes (Examples)
- Sensory: calm, refreshing, grounded, cozy, bright.
- Functional (non‑medical): elevate your commute; reset your space; designed for focus.
- Material: refillable, wood + glass, recyclable packaging, phthalate‑free oils, IFRA‑guided.

Avoid / Prohibited
- Medical: treats anxiety/depression/insomnia; cures headaches; therapeutic claims.
- Absolutes: toxin‑free, chemical‑free (use “phthalate‑free,” “no added dyes”).
- Safety guarantees: spill‑proof (use “designed to resist leaks when used as directed”).

Preferred Phrasing
- “Designed by data, crafted by nature.”
- “Refillable, minimalist scent objects for car and home.”
- “Most‑Loved This Month” based on customer ratings and sales.
- “IFRA‑guided formulations; SDS on file.”

Disclaimers (where needed)
- “Fragrance oils can stain porous surfaces; use included cork pad.”
- “Keep out of reach of children and pets.”
- “Do not ingest. Avoid contact with eyes and skin.”

Tone & Style
- Calm, confident, minimalist; short sentences; present tense.
- Show proof in small facts (ratings, reorder cadence) rather than superlatives.

Review Process
- New claims reviewed by Brand + Ops; check against SDS/IFRA docs.
- For exports, verify CLP/GHS label requirements per market.
