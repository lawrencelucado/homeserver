# AromaCo + Databin Analytics — One‑Pager

Tagline: Stack once, sell twice.

## Snapshot
- AromaCo: Premium, refillable passive car/home diffusers (wood, aluminum, glass). D2C + boutique wholesale.
- Databin Analytics: Self‑hosted analytics stack and services for small e‑commerce brands (Airflow → Postgres → Superset).

## Problem → Solution
- DTC brands lack clear marketing insights; car/home scent space is crowded with low‑quality, non‑refillable products.
- Solution: A minimalist, refillable diffuser brand guided by live analytics; the same analytics packaged as a service/SaaS.

## Offerings
- AromaCo Products: AromaPods (car), AromaDrops (refills), 3‑Pack Gift, Phase‑2 AromaHome. Subscription‑first refills.
- Databin Services: Analytics Stack Setup ($2k–$4k), Managed insights ($499–$999/mo), roadmap to SaaS dashboards.

## Why Us (Moat)
- Proof on our own store → credible case studies.
- Shared stack reduces cost; faster iteration; data‑guided roadmap.
- Eco‑premium hardware + Drift‑style brand, but smarter (personalized picks, refill cadence tuned by data).

## 12‑Month Plan
- Phase 1 (0–3 mo) Validate: 100–200 AromaCo units; 3–5 Databin clients; dashboards live on our store.
- Phase 2 (4–6 mo) Productize: Wholesale pilots; 7‑Day Analytics Setup; publish case study.
- Phase 3 (7–12 mo) Scale: Subscriptions + AromaHome; launch “RetailFlow” SaaS; 3PL readiness.

## Example Financial Model (EOY Target)
- Databin: ~25 clients → ~$15k MRR (~$180k ARR).
- AromaCo: 500 subs/units → ~$8k MRR (~$96k ARR).
- Combined: ~$23k MRR; ~$276k annualized.

## Tech Architecture (Self‑Hosted)
```
Next.js Store  →  FastAPI  →  PostgreSQL
                         ↘

                         ↘
                    Superset Dashboards
```
- Reusable schemas: orders, items, customers, ad_spend, experiments, inventory, subscriptions.

## Go‑To‑Market Highlights
