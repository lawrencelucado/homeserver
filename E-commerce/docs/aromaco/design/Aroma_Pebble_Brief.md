# Aroma Pebble — Product Design Brief (v0.1)

Objective
- Create a small resin/gypsum “pebble” decor that acts as a passive aromatherapy stone using existing oils.

Form & Materials
- Body: matte resin or gypsum stone; sealed bottom; porous top surface.
- Base: cork disc to prevent surface transfer; optional felt inlay.
- Finish: warm neutrals; micro‑texture; minimalist debossed mark.

Dimensions (provisional)
- 60–70 mm long x 40–50 mm wide x 20–25 mm tall; weight 70–120 g.

Performance Targets
- 8–10 drops → ≥ 3 hours noticeable throw at 22°C; re‑dose friendly.
- No oil ring after 2h on kraft; cork base intact after 30 uses.

Unit Economics
- Target COGS $3–$5; MSRP $18–$24; gross margin ≥ 65–75%.

QC & Tests
- Absorption/dry‑down time log; stain transfer; edge chip resistance (drop 0.5 m); color variance ≤ ΔE 2.0.

Packaging
- Small kraft tuck box; paper wrap; includes 10 ml oil option and cork pad; care card (dose guidance).

Risks & Mitigations
- Over‑absorption → partial surface seal or denser mix.
- Chipping → radius edges; denser resin; protective wrap.

Timeline
- Week 1: sample pours | Week 2: absorption tests | Week 3: packaging fit | Week 4: PO (200–300 units).
