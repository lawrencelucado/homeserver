- Carrier Base: Augeo Clean Multi (primary), optional DPG.
- Wick Options: felt rod (6–8 mm Ø), cotton rope (#3), reed slice; oil‑compatible.
- Seal/Gasket: PE cone or TPE insert for leak resistance.

- Mounting Seat (shells): pocket Ø 22.5 mm x D 15–18 mm with friction fit or M18x1.5 thread adapter.
- Venting: 3–6 pinholes (Ø 1.5–2.0 mm) or slit vents in shell; target open area 12–18 mm².

Performance Targets
- Car Pod: 25–35 days per 10 ml in typical use; no leak at 22°C/24h inverted; pass 40°C/1h.
- Desk Totem: Continuous throw radius 0.5–1 m; 30 days per 10 ml (intermittent top‑ups).
- Pebble: 8–10 drops → ≥3 hours noticeable throw; no surface staining (use cork pad).

- Absorption/Throw: time-to-dry logs; panel rating ≥ 4/5.
- Thermal Cycling: 5 cycles 10–40°C; no weep.
- Surface Transfer: no ring on kraft at 2h.
