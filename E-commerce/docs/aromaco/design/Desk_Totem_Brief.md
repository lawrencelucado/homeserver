# Desk Totem — Product Design Brief (v0.1)

Objective
- Design a minimalist desk decor object with an internal passive diffuser core (shared 10 ml refill).

Form & Materials
- Body: hardwood (oak/walnut) stackable modules or aluminum cylinder with hidden felt core.
- Base: cork or silicone anti-slip pad; optional aluminum weight puck.
- Refill: shared 10 ml vial; top-up via hidden fill port.

Dimensions (provisional)
- Wood stack: 45 x 45 mm footprint; height 90–120 mm.
- Aluminum cylinder: Ø 45–50 mm x H 80–100 mm; vent slits near top.

Performance Targets
- Throw radius 0.5–1.0 m at desk height; ≥ 30 days per 10 ml with intermittent opening.
- No surface staining; pass 2h transfer test on unfinished wood desk + kraft.

Unit Economics
- Target COGS $7–$10; MSRP $32–$45; gross margin ≥ 60–70%.

QC & Tests
- Absorption curve (felt/cotton); top-up leak test; drop 1 m x3; finish stain test.

Packaging
- Kraft box with molded pulp/foam insert; includes 10 ml refill + cork pad + care card.

Risks & Mitigations
- Over‑diffusion → adjustable vent area or removable cap.
- Finish reaction → pre‑seal wood; test oils on finish swatches.

Timeline
- Week 1: material samples (wood + felt + alu) | Week 2: proto test | Week 3: finalize | Week 4: PO (100–200).
