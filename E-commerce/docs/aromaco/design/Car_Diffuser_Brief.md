# Car Diffuser — Product Design Brief (v0.1)

Objective
- Create a premium, refillable passive car diffuser (AromaPods™) aligned with AromaCo’s minimalist, eco aesthetic.

Form & Materials
- Face: hardwood (ash/oak/walnut), laser-engraved wordmark; sealed with food-safe oil.
- Body: anodized aluminum or matte zinc alloy; internal magnet; vent slits.
- Mount: magnetic clip for car vent; optional 3M low-profile plate.
- Refill: 10 ml amber glass, 18/410 neck, orifice reducer; felt/cotton wick.

Dimensions (provisional)
- Ø 45–50 mm x 14–18 mm thick; clip depth 18–22 mm; weight ~35–55 g.

Performance Targets
- Lifetime: 25–35 days per 10 ml (normal usage).
- No leak: pass 24h inverted @ 22°C; pass 1h @ 40°C.
- Magnet retention: ≥ 1.5 kg pull; rattle test at 60 km/h over bumps.

Unit Economics
- Target COGS ≤ $5.50 landed (incl. clip, face, body, refill vial).
- MSRP $14.99–$17.99; gross margin ≥ 60–65%.

QC & Tests
- Leak, thermal cycling (10–40°C x5), drop (1 m x3 sides), label adhesion, cap torque.
- Visual: wood defects <2%, anodize scratches <1%.

Packaging
- Drawer kraft box with foam/corrugate insert; includes refill vial, safety card, cork pad (for home test setting).

Risks & Mitigations
- Heat creep → tighter reducer + PE gasket; smaller vent area.
- Clip looseness → add anti-slip silicone pad.

Timeline (proto → PO)
- Week 1: sample shortlist (3 vendors) | Week 2: tests | Week 3: select + finalize | Week 4: 100–300 unit PO.
