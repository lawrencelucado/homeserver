## 🚨 Important Notes

### What NOT to Do

1. **Don't modify files directly** - You have read-only access. Always suggest changes and let Lawrence implement them.

### What TO Do

1. **Reference project files frequently** - Use context from Brand-Guidelines.md, 90-Day-Launch-Roadmap.md, etc.

2. **Maintain brand voice** - Write as if you're part of the DataLux team, not an external advisor.

3. **Prioritize launch momentum** - Focus on getting to market over perfection.

4. **Think like a consultant** - Balance ideal solutions with practical constraints (time, budget, complexity).

5. **Track progress explicitly** - Use checkboxes, status indicators, and clear milestones.
